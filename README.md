# Chocolate City

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app). using Typescript

For some reaso, when I deployed and dockerized...only the home page fetches data..Other pages couldn't.(No time to debug this so you can just run the app locally or better still run with docker and twll me what the you think the issue was ...Gracias..)

## Available Scripts

Run using docker:

### `git clone git@github.com:nkemjikaobi/active-edge.git`
### `cd active-edge`
### `yarn docker:bash`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

In the project directory, to run locally:[PREFERRED]

### `git clone git@github.com:nkemjikaobi/active-edge.git`
### `cd active-edge`
### `yarn install`
Then, 
### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.


The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

Excercise 1 can be found on the root directory of the application.

To run, install node, then

### `cd active-edge/excercise1`
### `node exercise.js`

Feel free to choose whatver rocks your boat.

The assessment wasnt completed but what was done was superb [Structure, Interfaces and the likes].

Happy Hacking!!!.
